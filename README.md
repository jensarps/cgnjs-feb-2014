This is the example code from my CologneJS talk in February 2014.

## Notes

Please note that the goal of the presentation was to show how quickly one can
setup a 3D scene. The example code reflects that. Player (i.e. camera) movement
is done in a very simplistic way, and so is collision detection. Though it works
the way it is done, you will quickly hit the limits of this implementation.

Use this as a starting point, and go on from there â€“ just keep on being inspired
and have fun!
